Multi threading is concept to run multiple thread at a time
to run various operation in code at a same time.


default java run single thread at a time,
using thread we can manage multi threads,

two methods,
    1. using extends Thread class,
        - it allows only one class to extends
        - because java not allowed multiple inheritance
        - so, if Thread class is used then no other class allowed to use
    2. using implements Runnable interface,
        - it allow multiple interface to implements
        - it allows to extend other class , also allows to add other interface with Runnable

if one thread is got exception then it will not affect on other threads
